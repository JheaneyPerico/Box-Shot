\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item {\itshape Shoot and kill} all zombies, while evading them (avoid collision) to win and progress through levels.
\item As level progress, the number of zombies will increase. New zombie types will be introduced, including zombies who are faster and have a higher hit point.
\item Wall structure will be different per level. As levels increase, so will the number of walls. The player can not shoot through the wall, and zombies can not go through the wall.
\item The character will die when hit point reaches 0.
