GAME PLAN:

1.  Shoot and kill all zombies, while trying to avoid getting hit (collide by them). 
2. The levels will have different number of zombies attacking you, depending on the level you're in. There will also more walls as levels increase. You can not shoot through the wall, and zombies can not go through the wall.
3.  Players can collect boxes which will upgrade their gun, increasing firing rate, range, etc.


Progression:
Added Splash Screen and buttons.
