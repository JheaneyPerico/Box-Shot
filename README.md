GAME PLAN:

1.  Shoot and kill all zombies, while evading them (avoid collision) to win and progress through levels. 
2. As level progress, the number of zombies will increase. New zombie types will be introduced, including zombies who are faster and have a higher hit point.
3. Wall structure will be different per level. As levels increase, so will the number of walls. The player can not shoot through the wall, and zombies can not go through the wall.
4. Players can collect orange boxes which will upgrade their gun, increasing firing rate, range, etc.
5. The character will die when hit point reaches 0.
