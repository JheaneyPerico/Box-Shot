# BOX SHOT
**Box Shot** is a simple 2d 3rd person terminal game created using C language that requires the player to survive and eliminate all zombies to win. Each level will get more difficult. Have fun!

## GAME PLAN:
1.  *Shoot and kill* all zombies, while evading them (avoid collision) to win and progress through levels. 
2. As level progress, the number of zombies will increase. New zombie types will be introduced, including zombies who are faster and have a higher hit point.
3. Wall structure will be different per level. As levels increase, so will the number of walls. The player can not shoot through the wall, and zombies can not go through the wall.
4. The character will die when hit point reaches 0.
